    ### **Agent**: The Stillness of Stars

    After another player replenishes commodities:

    You may exhaust this card to convert their commodities to trade goods and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">capture</span> 1 unit from their reinforcements that has a cost equal to or lower than their commodity value. 

    ### **Commander**: That Which Molds Flesh
    
    _Unlock: Have units in 3 Gravity Rifts_

    When you produce fighter or infantry units:

    Up to 2 of those units do not count against your <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">production</span> limit. 

    ### **Hero**: It Feeds on Carrion - DIMENSIONAL ANCHOR
    
    _Unlock: Have 3 Scored Objectives_

    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action</span>: Each other player rolls a die for each of their non-fighter ships that are in or adjacent to a system that contains a dimensional tear; on a 1-3, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">capture</span> that unit. If this causes a player's ground forces or fighters to be removed, also <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">capture</span> those units.

    Then, purge this card.
