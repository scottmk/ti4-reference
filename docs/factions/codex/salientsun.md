    The Salient Sun joint task force is an alliance of the [Federation of Sol](../base/sol.md) and the [Xxcha Kingdom](../base/xxcha.md) for the Liberation of Ordinian scenario found in [Codex IV](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/f6/be/f6be8343-a4fc-47e4-a722-efe3e01fc5d9/ti_codex_4_rules.pdf).

    The Xxcha Kingdom and Federation of Sol players are allied; they resolve the setup step 3 from the Alliance game variant in [Codex II](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/ff/fe/fffe5e9d-33fb-4149-a3a2-cd6dfadb4de3/ti_codex_ii_rules_web.pdf). 
    They also gain the FSS Orlando hero card.
