-   ## __Faction Abilities__

    ---
    ### **Rally to the Cause**
    
    Once per action, after you produce 1 or more ships in your home system, you may produce up to 2 ships in a system that contains a cultural, hazardous, or industrial planet and does not contain a legendary planet or other players' units.

    ### **Diplomats**
    
    Once per action, you may exhaust 1 uncontrolled planet's planet card that is on the game board to spend its resources or influence.

    ### **Free People**
    
    During setup, for each non-home planet other than Mecatol Rex on the game board, place that planet's planet card face up on the game board.

    <sup><sub>NB: This is for the Free Systems Compact player to keep track of which uncontrolled planets they have exhausted with the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diplomats</span> faction ability.
    It does not change the fact that when a player takes control of a planet, they receive that planet exhausted.</sub></sup>
