    ### **Abyssal Embrace**
    
    When you create the game board, place the Ghoti Space tile where your home system would normally be placed.
    The Ghoti Space system is not a home system.

    ### **Mobile Command**
    
    The system that contains your flagship is your home system.
    Your flagship cannot be captured and you cannot score public objectives if your flagship is not on the game board.

    ### **Spawning Grounds**
    
    During setup, gain and ready the Ghoti planet card and its planet ability card; you cannot lose those cards.
