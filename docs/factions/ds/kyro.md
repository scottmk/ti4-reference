    ---
    ### **Contagion**
    
    After you resolve the primary or secondary ability of the "Politics" strategy card, commit 1 infantry from your reinforcements to a planet that is in or adjacent to a system that contains a planet you control; resolve invasion on that planet.

    ### **Plague Reservoir**
    
    Once per action, during invasion on a planet that contains your units, you may resolve ground combat on that planet, even if it does not contain another player's ground forces.

    ### **Subversive**
    
    When participating in a combat that would end in a draw, you are treated as the winner instead.
