    ### **Cunning**
    
    After you perform a tactical action in a system, you may attach 1 "Trap" card from your reinforcements to a planet in that system that contains 1 or more of your infantry units.

    ### **Subterfuge**
    
    Trap attachments are attached face-down and remain hidden until revealed; you may look at Trap attachments at any time. 
    You do not count trap attachments toward fulfilling objectives.
