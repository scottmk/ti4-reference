    ### **Fine Print**
    
    After a player resolves the secondary ability of 1 of your strategy cards, place up to 1 of their control tokens on your faction sheet.

    ### **Collateralized Loans**
    
    After 1 of your opponent's ships is destroyed during a round of space combat, you may remove 1 of that player's control tokens from your faction sheet to place 1 ship of that type from your reinforcements in the active system.

    ### **Binding Debts**
    
    Other players may place their control tokens on your faction sheet at any time. 
    
    At the start of the status phase, each of your neighbors may give you 1 trade good to remove up to 2 of their control tokens from your faction sheet.
