    ### **Corporate Entity**
    
    During setup, take the additional Veldyr faction promissory notes; you have 4 faction promissory notes. 
    "Branch Office" attachments do not count toward scoring objectives.

    ### **Holding Company**
    
    At the start of the status phase, for each planet that has a Branch Office attachment, you may gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities to a trade good.

    ### **Targeted Acquisition**
    
    At the start of the status phase, you may give 1 of your faction promissory notes in your hand to 1 of your neighbors.
