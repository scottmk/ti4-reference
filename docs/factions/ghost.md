    ---
    ### **Quantum Entaglement**
    
    You treat all systems that contain either an alpha or beta wormhole as adjacent to each other. Game effects cannot prevent you from using this ability.

    ### **Slipstream**
    
    During your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system that contains either an alpha or beta wormhole.

    ### **Creuss Gate**
    
    When you create the game board, place the Creuss Gate (tile 17) where your home system would normally be placed. The Creuss Gate system is not a home system. 
    Then, place your home system (tile 51) in your play area.

    ### **Agent**: Emissary Taivra
    
    After a player activates a system that contains a non-delta wormhole:

    You may exhaust this card; if you do, that system is adjacent to all other systems that contain a wormhole during this tactical action. 

    ### **Commander**: Sai Seravus
    
    _Unlock: Have units in 3 systems that contain alpha or beta wormholes._

    After your ships move:

    For each ship that has a capacity value and moved through 1 or more wormholes, you may place 1 fighter from your reinforcements with that ship if you have unused capacity in the active system. 

    ### **Hero**: Riftwalker Meian - SINGULARITY REACTOR
    
    _Unlock: Have 3 Scored Objectives_

    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action</span>: Swap the positions of any 2 systems that contain wormholes or your units, other than the Creuss system and the Wormhole Nexus.

    Then, purge this card.
