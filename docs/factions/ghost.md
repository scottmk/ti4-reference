-   ## __Faction Abilities__

    ---
    ### **Quantum Entaglement**
    
    You treat all systems that contain either an alpha or beta wormhole as adjacent to each other. Game effects cannot prevent you from using this ability.

    ### **Slipstream**
    
    During your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system that contains either an alpha or beta wormhole.

    ### **Creuss Gate**
    
    When you create the game board, place the Creuss Gate (tile 17) where your home system would normally be placed. The Creuss Gate system is not a home system. 
    Then, place your home system (tile 51) in your play area.
