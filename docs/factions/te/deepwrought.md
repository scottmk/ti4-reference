    ### **Research Team**
    
    When ground forces are committed, if your units on that planet are not already coexisting, you may choose for your units to coexist.

    ### **Oceanbound**
    
    When your units begin coexisting on a planet, gain an ocean card and ready it.
    Any time you have more oceans cards than there are planets that contain your coexisting units, discard ocean cards until you do not.

    ??? example "**Ocean Cards**"

        ##### Brine Pool
        :ti4-planets-resources-1: :ti4-planets-influence-1:

        _Sites with unique oceanic chemistry are of obvious interest to Deepwrought Researchers._

        ##### Coral Reef
        :ti4-planets-resources-1: :ti4-planets-influence-1:

        _Coral-analogues have evolved on many worlds, and their "reefs" are always areas of intense biodiversity._

        ##### Deep Abyss
        :ti4-planets-resources-1: :ti4-planets-influence-1:

        _The Abyssal zone features such dramatic pressure that even most Hylar need assistance to survive in the lightless depths._

        ##### Ice Shelf
        :ti4-planets-resources-1: :ti4-planets-influence-1:

        _Drylanders frequently discount the scientific opportunities to be found beneath their own polar ice sheets._

        ##### Lost Fleet
        :ti4-planets-resources-1: :ti4-planets-influence-1:

        _Although usually badly degraded by water and time, shipwrecks remain fascinating areas of exploration and study, whether those ships sailed sea or stars._
