    ---
    === "Firmament"
        ### :ti4-faction-te-firmament: **Plots Within Plots**
        
        You can score secret objectives already scored by other players if you fulfill their requirements; this does not count against your secret objective limit or the number you can score in a round.
        When you score another player's secret objective, do not gain a victory point; instead, place a facedown plot card into your play area with that player's control token on it.

        ### :ti4-faction-te-firmament: **Puppets of the Blade**
        
        If you have at least 1 plot card in your play area, gain the following ability:

        <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action</span>: Purge The Firmament's faction sheet, leaders, planet cards, and promissory note.
        Then, gain all the faction components for The Obsidian.
    
    === "Obsidian"
        ### :ti4-faction-te-obsidian: **Nocturne**
        
        This faction cannot be chosen during setup.

        ### :ti4-faction-te-obsidian: **The Blade's Orchestra**
        
        When this faction comes into play, flip your home system, double-sided faction components, and all of your in-play <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">plot</span> cards. 
        Then, ready Cronos Hollow and Tallin Hollow.

        ### :ti4-faction-te-obsidian: **Marionettes**
        
        The player or players whose control tokens are on each plot card are the puppeted players for that plot.

    Apply +1 to the results of each of your combat and unit ability rolls against the puppeted player.

    #### Enervate

    You can perform the secondary ability of the puppeted player's strategy cards without spending command tokens; for "Leadership," you can perform the primary ability instead.

    #### Extract

    When the puppeted player gains a non-faction technology, you may spend 4 resources to gain that technology.

    #### Seethe

    When this card is revealed, destroy all units on a non-home planet controlled by a puppeted player.

    At the start of the status phase, destroy 1 of the puppeted player's infantry in any system.

    #### Siphon

    When the puppeted player gains commodities, you gain an equal number of trade goods.
