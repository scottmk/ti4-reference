    ### **Survival Instinct**
    
    After another player activates a system that contains your ships, you may move up to 2 of your ships into the active system from adjacent systems that do not contain your command tokens.

    ### **Miniaturization**
    
    Your structures can be transported by any ship; this does not require or count against capacity.
    While your structures are in the space area, they cannot use their unit abilities.
    At the end of your tactical actions, you may place your structures that are in space areas onto planets you control in their respective systems.
