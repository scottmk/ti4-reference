    ### **Sundered**
    
    You cannot use wormholes other than epsilon wormholes.
    Other players' units that move or are placed into your home system are destroyed.

    ### **Incursion**
    
    When you activate a system that contains a breach, you may flip that breach; systems that contain active breaches are adjacent.
    At the end of the status phase, any player with ships in a system that contains an active breach may remove that breach.

    ### **The Sorrow**
    
    When you create the game board, place The Sorrow (tile 94) where your home system would be placed, and place an inactive breach in it. 
    The Sorrow is not a home system. 
    Then, place your home system (tile 118) in your play area.
