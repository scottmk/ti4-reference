## Faction Technologies

Whenever you take part in a splice—including the inaugural splice—you may instead choose to take one of the following faction technologies instead of a splice card.
These technologies do not have any prerequisites, do not count as any technology color, and cannot be lost once gained.

Note that you must play with the _Prophecy of Kings_ expansion to use the abilities preceded with a <sup><sub>:ti4-pok:</sub></sup> icon.

But flesh is weakness.
And all weakness must be eradicated._
