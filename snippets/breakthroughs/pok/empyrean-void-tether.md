### :ti4-faction-pok-empyrean: **Void Tether** :ti4-te:

When you activate a system that contains or is adjacent to a unit or planet you control, you may place or move 1 of your void tether tokens onto a border that system shares with another system; other players do not treat those systems as adjacent to each other unless you allow it.
