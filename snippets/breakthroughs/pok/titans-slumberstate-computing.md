When <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coalescence</span> results in a ground combat, if you commit no other units, you may choose for your units to coexist instead.
During the status phase, for each player you are coexisting with, you and that player each draw 1 additional action card.

Other players may allow you to place a sleeper token on a planet they control.
