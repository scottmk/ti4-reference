### :ti4-faction-ds-vaylerian: __Vaylerian Scourge â€“ Clan's Favor__ :ti4-ds:

---
At the start of a round of space combat:

The Vaylerian player discards 1 action card. 
Then, move all of your ships from the active system to an adjacent system that does not contain another player's ships; the space combat ends in a draw.

Then, place a command token from your reinforcements in that system and return this card to the Vaylerian player.
