At the start of a space combat against a player other than the Nomad: 

During this combat, treat 1 of your non-fighter ships as if it has the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sustain Damage</span> ability, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Combat</span> value, and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anti-Fighter Barrage</span> value of the Nomad's flagship. 

Return this card to the Nomad player at the end of the combat.
