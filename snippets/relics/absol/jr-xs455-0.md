*There was a long moment, stretching in silence until Dart blurted, "Can we help you somehow?"*

*All of the individuals seemed startled by the question, but the titan seemed the most perplexed.*

*"I have no name. You," it said, pointing to Dart. "Perhaps I shall be Dart II."*

*"H-how about Junior instead?" Dart offered.*

*"I wouldn't want anyone to get us confused, we already look so... uh... alike."*

"Yes. Yes, this is true." It turned.
"Junior. Yes. I like that name, and I would also like to come with you."*
