### **Luxarch Treatise**:ti4-absol:

When performing a tactical action, you may exhaust this card to activate a system that contains 1 of your command tokens.

<sup><sub>Note: Still costs a command token</sub></sup>

When you activate a system, you may place this card next to the game board.
If you do, you may ignore your fleet pool limit and add +2 to the results of your ships' combat rolls in the active system.
At the end of that action, purge this card.

*Written thousands of years before the fall of the Lazax, the Luxarch Treatsie contained detailed analyses of the Lazax's greatest victories.  With the return of the Mahact, it was imperative that the document be found.*
