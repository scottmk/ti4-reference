### **The Prophet's Tears**:ti4-absol:

When you would research a technology or use a faction ability instead of researching a technology, you may ignore 1 prerequisite or draw 1 action card.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action</span>: Research 2 technologies, then purge this card.
Faction abilities cannot prevent you from researching these technologies.
