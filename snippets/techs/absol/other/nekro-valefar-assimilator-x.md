### :ti4-faction-nekro: **Valefar Assimilator X**:ti4-absol:

Requirements: None

When you would gain another player's technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the "X" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead.
While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text.

You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.
