When 1 or more of your units use <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bombardment</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Space Cannon</span>, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional die.

When the result of your non-fighter ships' combat roll exceeds that ship's combat value by 3 or more, your opponent may not assign that hit to a fighter unless they first destroy 1 of their fighters in the active system.
