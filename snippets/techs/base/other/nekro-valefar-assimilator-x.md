### :ti4-tech-none: **Valefar Assimilator X**

Requirements: None

When you would gain another player's technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the "X" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead.
While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text.
You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.
