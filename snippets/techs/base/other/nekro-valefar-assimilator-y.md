### :ti4-faction-base-nekro: **Valefar Assimilator Y**

Requirements: None

When you would gain another players technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the "Y" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead.
While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text.

You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.
